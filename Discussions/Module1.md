In this week's discussion, please select a data set you are interested in (possibly something from below sites), and describe 
in a few sentences what types of questions you could envision answering on this network. 
Optionally, you can build a network from this data and share the graphml file with your classmates. 
Examples of how to create and save networks are provided in the posted Python and Java code examples.
