In this week's discussion, please select a data set you are interested in (possibly something from below sites), and describe 
in a few sentences what types of questions you could envision answering on this network. 
Optionally, you can build a network from this data and share the graphml file with your classmates. 
Examples of how to create and save networks are provided in the posted Python and Java code examples.

Personally, having a background in nuclear physics, I found the "High-energy physics citation network" dataset (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ca-HepPh.html)  from SNAP to be very interesting. In the research groups, I used to be a part of, there was a lot of debate on the hottest trends in nuclear and high energy physics, both from an experimental and theory perspective, so having this raw data to visualize could've helped us decide empirically what were the hottest papers of the day (if this data set was more recent). 

1. It would be interesting to see the evolution in topics based on the edges between certain papers and seeing how they evolve over time based on the authors. This could show us which topics were of most interest at one time, and how those questions either got answered or how the topics of interest/ questions evolved into new topics as the nodes change over time. 
2. It could show us the most popular authors based on those papers as well. 
3. We could possibly try to extrapolate some social networks/ peer group networks from this data based on the nodes and how often those authors are grouped together. 
4. I'm not sure if it's possible, but it would also be cool to see the connections between authors and the national labs/ collaborations they are a part of and possibly build a social network that way from this data. 

This is also a relatively old data set (data is from January 1993 - 2003), so it would be interesting to see how those papers faired in the 19 years since the end of the initial collection data and see if those papers are still cited. It would also be cool to see what the more modern data would look like for those same questions above.
