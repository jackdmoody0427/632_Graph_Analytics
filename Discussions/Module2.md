In this week's discussion, we will discuss using matrix vs graph API based methods in implementation of graph algorithms. Please post at least one message comparing matrix representation & graph API, which one would you prefer to use to implement an algorithm and why ? You can consider attribute rich data, question of parallelization, and any other aspect that makes one more appealing to you, If there are specific Sparse matrix libraries or graph processing frameworks you are familiar you can mention them with a few sentences. Reply to two of your classmate's original responses as well
