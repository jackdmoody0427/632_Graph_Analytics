In this week's discussion, we will discuss using matrix vs graph API based methods in implementation of graph algorithms. Please post at least one message comparing matrix representation & graph API, which one would you prefer to use to implement an algorithm and why ? You can consider attribute rich data, question of parallelization, and any other aspect that makes one more appealing to you, If there are specific Sparse matrix libraries or graph processing frameworks you are familiar you can mention them with a few sentences. Reply to two of your classmate's original responses as well

I think as someone who comes from the mathematics world, I would lean more towards matrix representation because it is more in my comfort zone. However, in my professional life, where I spend a lot of time communicating highly technical information to a non technical audience, it would be much harder for me to show a matrix API versus a graph API. I feel most audiences, regardless of mathematical background, would be able to grasp a graph API faster than a matrix API. Most of the data I work with is very large too, which is easier to show most audiences graphically versus in a matrix. 

However, we must mention how helpful matrix operations are and how quickly they can help us yield useful results with our data, which graph APIs might not be able to provide as quickly or readily.
